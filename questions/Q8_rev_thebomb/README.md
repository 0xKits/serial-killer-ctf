## Case Overview
As the investigation into a notorious serial killer closes in on his true identity and hideouts, the killer makes a final, desperate move to avert capture. In a chilling act of defiance, he sends a decompiled binary to the government, claiming it’s a time bomb set to detonate unless the investigation is called off. With the stakes higher than ever, authorities now face the critical task of analyzing the binary, fully aware that any misstep could lead to devastating consequences—while the killer, cornered and unhinged, remains a deadly threat.
